Initial commit. Took a week from the initial start up date to commit to github, but was about 4-5 hours of actual "coding". The foundation was there from the beginning but the correct working of the "equals" button slowed down project completion time. Minor bugs such as clear button needing to be utilized in-between operations, and the screen needing to display past operations as well. Will be fixed in next update. Overall pleased with turnout.
